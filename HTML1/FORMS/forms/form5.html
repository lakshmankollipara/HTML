      <H2>Fill-Out Form Example #5 </H2>
      This is another fill-out form example, with 
various text entry field attributes demonstrated. 
      <P>
      <P>
      <FORM action=index.php method=post>
        The 
first text entry field has no special attributes: 
        <INPUT name=entry1>
         
        <P>The second text entry field is twice as long (displays up to 40 characters, 
instead of the default 20): 
          <INPUT size=40 name=entry2>
           
        <P>Each of the first two text entry fields can hold as many characters as the 
user wishes to type (into the millions). The following text entry field, 
however, is limited to five characters, and beeps when the user tries to enter 
more: 
          <INPUT maxLength=5 size=5 name=entry3>
           
        <P>To submit the query, press this button: 
          <INPUT type=submit value="Submit Query">
        <P>To clear the form, press this button: 
          <INPUT type=reset value="Clear Form">
      </FORM>
    </td>
  </tr>
